# To Do List Project
# Abeer Yahya & Aisha'a Hussein.
# Introduction to the Project:

The To-Do List project is a simple and interactive Python application designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application enables users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates essential Python programming concepts, making it an ideal graduation project for a Python course.


We utilized Object-Oriented Programming to organize the code. We have a class AbstractToDoList that defines the structure of the operations to be implemented in the subclasses. Then, the class User_Functions implements these operations:

  1. Inheritance and Abstraction:  
       Through inheritance, the class User_Functions implements the abstract methods defined in the abstract class AbstractToDoList.
     
  2. Error Handling:  
       In case of attempting to delete an unselected task, the error is handled using try-except, where an error message is displayed to the user.


# Objective :
The application allows users to add a new task, delete a specific task , delete all tasks , and close the application using an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Tasks are displayed in a list that dynamically updates with any changes.

# App Features:
1.Add tasks .
2.Delete a specific task .
3.Delete all tasks .
4.Close the App easily .
5.Simple and user-friendly graphical interface.

# How the Project Works:
Graphical Interface: The application consists of three main frames: one for displaying the title, one for the buttons and input field, and the therd frame is for displaying the task list. The Tkinter library is used to create this interface.
User Interaction: When text is entered in the input field, the user can add the task to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button. If the user wants to delete a task, they can select it from the list and click "Delete Task."

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for solving real-life problems like task management. It is a simple yet effective tool for organizing daily activities and a solid foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface.
